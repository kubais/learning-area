        // "for loop" - We declare a variable i and assign it 1: the initial value of the variable i in our loop. The second clause, i <= answer is our condition. We want to loop until i is greater than answer. The third clause, i++, tells our loop to increment i by 1 every iteration. As a result, if the user inputs 10, this loop would print numbers 1 - 10 to the console.

                console.log("FizzBuzz"); // condition of dividable by both 3 a 5 had to go first, otherwise it would finish at either 3 or 5 and not ever print by 3 AND 5.
